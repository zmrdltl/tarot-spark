# tarot-spark

Free tarot card drawing and AI prompt generator built with Next.js.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 LTS and the pinned pnpm version for local development and CI.
This repository includes `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` for local version
managers.

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.1.1 --activate
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm dev
```

## Configuration

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the production origin before deployment. It is used
for canonical URLs, alternate language links, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`.
Local builds fall back to `http://localhost:3000`.

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHARE_SITE_URL` only when share links should use a different
origin from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. The value must be reachable outside the
local machine, so do not use `localhost` for KakaoTalk sharing. In production,
leave it unset so share links use the production origin.

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` to the Google Analytics measurement ID, such as
`G-XXXXXXXXXX`, to enable page view tracking and tarot behavior events. Leave it
unset for local development or preview deployments that should not send GA data.

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_KAKAO_JS_KEY` to enable KakaoTalk sharing. Kakao domains:
`App > JavaScript SDK domain` must include the app origin, and
`App > Product Link > Web domain` must include the shared URL origin
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHARE_SITE_URL`, otherwise `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`).
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_KAKAO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the comma-separated origins
registered in Kakao. It must include both the running origin and the shared URL
origin, otherwise the KakaoTalk button stays hidden.

Use `.env.local` for local values. The committed `.env.example` file documents
the expected keys.
