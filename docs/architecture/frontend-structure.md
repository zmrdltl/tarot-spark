# Frontend Structure

## Scope

Use this guide when adding routes, feature UI, shared components, tarot data,
or frontend helpers.

## Goals

- Keep route files focused on routing, metadata, and page composition.
- Keep feature behavior close to the feature that owns it.
- Keep shared UI free of tarot domain logic and public copy.
- Move repeated logic, data, and UI to one source of truth before it spreads.
- Avoid catch-all folders such as `common`, `shared`, or `utils`.

## Directory Shape

Use this target shape as the app grows:

```text
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
    globals.css
  components/
    layout/
    ui/
  domain/
    tarot/
      cards.ts
      spreads.ts
      prompts.ts
      topics.ts
      types.ts
  features/
    tarot-reading/
      components/
      hooks/
      TarotExperience.tsx
      analytics.ts
      index.ts
  lib/
  styles/
tests/
  e2e/
```

The project does not need every directory at once. Add a directory when a
feature, shared component, or domain object needs a stable home.

## Current MVP Placement

The single-route MVP may keep the first route-owned experience files in
`src/app` while all of these are true:

- One route owns the full interaction.
- No other route, feature, or test imports the file through a non-route path.
- The file is still small enough to review as one route-owned unit.
- The next expected change is not a second topic route, shared component, or
  reusable tarot helper.

Move colocated MVP files before the first change that breaks those conditions:

```text
src/app/TarotExperience.tsx -> src/features/tarot-reading/TarotExperience.tsx
src/app/tarot-data.ts -> src/domain/tarot/
src/app/analytics.ts -> src/features/tarot-reading/analytics.ts
```

## Folder Responsibilities

- `src/app` owns App Router files, route layouts, route metadata, and route-level
  composition.
- `src/features/<feature>` owns user-facing workflows such as card draw,
  reading reveal, prompt generation, copy actions, and sharing.
- `src/features/<feature>/components` owns components that are coupled to that
  feature's state, copy, events, or tarot behavior.
- `src/components/ui` owns domain-free primitives such as buttons, inputs,
  dialogs, tabs, cards, and tooltips.
- `src/components/layout` owns app shell components such as navigation, footer,
  page frame, and persistent layout regions.
- `src/domain/tarot` owns typed tarot data, tarot types, spread definitions,
  prompt templates, and pure tarot helpers.
- `src/lib` owns framework-agnostic helpers that are not tarot-specific.
- `src/styles` owns shared styling helpers that do not belong in
  `globals.css`.
- `tests/e2e` owns Playwright smoke flows.

## File Classification

- Route files are framework-defined files such as `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
  `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, route metadata, and route-only tests.
- Feature files own one user workflow, such as selecting a topic, drawing cards,
  revealing results, copying prompts, or sharing a reading.
- Feature components render workflow-specific UI and may use feature state,
  feature analytics names, tarot copy, or browser interaction state.
- Feature hooks own client interaction state when more than one feature
  component needs the same state transition.
- Domain files own typed tarot facts, spread definitions, prompt builders,
  interpretation templates, and pure tarot helpers.
- Shared UI files own domain-free primitives that can render without tarot data,
  analytics event names, route metadata, or public copy.
- Layout files own app shell, navigation, footer, page frame, and persistent
  regions that are not tied to one workflow.
- Library files own generic browser or TypeScript helpers that are not tied to
  tarot, a route, or a feature workflow.
- Style files own reusable styling tokens or helpers that do not belong in
  `globals.css`.

## Placement Rules

- Place a new file in the narrowest owner that can change it safely.
- Keep route composition in `src/app`; move reusable behavior out before a
  second route imports it.
- Keep workflow-specific state, event names, copy, and browser actions inside
  the owning feature.
- Keep tarot domain data and pure tarot logic in `src/domain/tarot`, even when
  the first consumer is a single feature.
- Keep shared UI primitive props domain-free; pass tarot labels, descriptions,
  and event handlers from the feature.
- Keep generic helpers in `src/lib` only when they have no tarot, feature, or
  route vocabulary.
- Split a file when it contains two owners, such as tarot data plus React UI, or
  feature state plus shared primitive styling.

## Import Direction

Keep imports flowing from product composition toward lower-level building
blocks:

```text
src/app -> src/features -> src/components/ui
src/app -> src/features -> src/domain/tarot
src/features -> src/lib
src/domain/tarot -> src/lib
```

- Shared UI components must not import from `src/app`, `src/features`, or
  `src/domain/tarot`.
- Domain files must not import React components or route files.
- Feature modules may import shared UI, domain data, and generic helpers.
- Cross-feature imports should go through the feature's `index.ts`.
- Route files should import feature entry points instead of feature internals.

## Component Strategy

- Start components in the route or feature that first needs them.
- Promote a component to `src/components/ui` only when it is domain-free and
  useful in more than one feature or route.
- Promote a component to `src/components/layout` only when it represents app
  shell or repeated page framing.
- Keep feature components in `src/features/<feature>/components` when they use
  feature state, analytics names, tarot copy, tarot data, or flow-specific
  behavior.
- Prefer composition through `children` and small typed props over broad config
  objects.
- Keep primitive variants limited to durable design choices such as `variant`,
  `size`, `disabled`, and `aria-*` behavior.
- Keep public copy outside shared UI primitives.
- Put repeated tarot content, prompt text, and interpretation templates in
  `src/domain/tarot` before reusing them in multiple views.

## Naming

- Use framework-defined names for App Router files such as `page.tsx`,
  `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, and `error.tsx`.
- Use `PascalCase.tsx` for component files with one primary exported component.
- Use lowercase kebab-case for non-component modules when a framework does not
  define the filename.
- Use `index.ts` as a small feature boundary that exports the public feature
  API.
- Keep test filenames next to the unit they cover, using `.test.ts` or
  `.test.tsx`.

## State And Data

- Keep component-local state in the component that owns the interaction.
- Move state to a feature hook or feature module when multiple components in
  the same feature need it.
- Keep tarot card, spread, topic, prompt, and interpretation data typed.
- Keep browser storage, analytics, and clipboard helpers behind small wrapper
  functions in the feature or `src/lib`.
- Do not add global state until at least two independent routes need the same
  mutable client state.

## Testing

- Add Vitest coverage for shared UI behavior, feature logic, and tarot helpers.
- Add component tests beside the component or feature they cover.
- Keep Playwright coverage in `tests/e2e` for page load, card draw, result
  reveal, prompt copy, and share entry points.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent from live ads, live analytics, and
  external AI calls.
